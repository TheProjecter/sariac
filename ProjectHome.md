Sariac is a front-end of popular CLI download manager 'aria2'.

I've been an aria2c fanboy for a long since. But what pains me most is that people get beware of it because of it being CLI. So my small effort towards deminishing this restriction is Sariac which is written in java, my home. Tried doing that in Mono/ C# but it's not my cup of tea. :)


Now I'm working for a pre-alpha release.
